# CollaborativeClasses
 
Collaborative Classes is a mod that aims to bring a stronger focus on classes in vintage story.
This includes changing the postives and negatives of the classes to be more focused on collaborative gameplay.
Many of the classes now specialize in only a few particular things, with a set of negatives to things they are not good at.
With the aim of the mod to promote trading and collaboration on servers, I would recommend not playing in single player.
